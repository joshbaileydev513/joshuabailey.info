## Description
For this Week 20 Challenge we were tasked with creating a refactoring our previous portfolio pagae with react. The app will have reusable components such as Headers, Footers,and a NavBar. Those specific components will then be used on the different pages for my portfolio such as a one for my resume, portfolio pieces, contact, and a home page. These pages all have their own routes defined on the app.js file which are linked back to each specfic page.

## Installation
For installation instructions please visit my github repo https://github.com/joshbaileydev513/joshuabailey.info to clone and review the README provided.

## Usage
In order to use this app you will first need to navigate to the `joshuabailey.info` folder and open up a terminal. When the terminal is open, run the command `npm i` to install your dependencies. When those are finished installing, type `npm run build` into your GitBash terminal which will cd to the client folder and run npm build. Once that is finished, you will type the command `npm run start` which will start the server and open up our localhost on port 3000. Click on that link `http://localhost:3000` to view it within the browser. Once you are there, you can begin by seeing the home page with a picture of myself and a brief description. At the top of the page you will notice the `JB` logo in the upper left which will always link you back to the home page. To the upper right, you will notice the navigation section between different pages for `Contact`, `Portfolio`, and `Resume`. The Contact page will have buttons for both a `Email`
and `Call` which will either open up an email to reach out or my number to call. On the Portfolio page there are examples of previous projects I have done along with links to the deployed application and repo. Lastly, there is the Resume section where you can download a PDF version of my current resume!
