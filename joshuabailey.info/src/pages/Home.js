                    Hi there! I am a FullStack Developer within MERN, currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp at The University
                    of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am passionate about creating visually appealing and user-friendly
                    websites and applications. My goal is to use my skills and knowledge to create meaningful and impactful digital
                    experiences for users. In my free time, I enjoy staying up to date with the latest technology and trends in the industry
                    and participating in coding challenges. I am excited to continue learning and growing as a developer, and I am eager to
                    start applying my skills to real-world projects. Thank you for visiting my website!
